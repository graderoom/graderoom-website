## [Announcement 7.0.0] - 2024-05-15 - A message from Joel
- <b>This is a long announcement. Please read it completely.</b><br><br><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>You may have noticed that Graderoom has not been able to connect to PowerSchool recently. Today, I was informed by a student that the school administration has intentionally blocked Graderoom from connecting to PowerSchool. I did not receive any communication from the school related to this, and was not given any way to resolve this issue with them. So, for the time being, it seems like syncing with PowerSchool for Bellarmine students will not be possible.</p><p>I am grateful that my website was helpful to all of you over the past few years. When I started this project, I could not have imagined the success and growth that I see today.</p><p>Please spread the word to people who may not see this announcement.</p><br><p><b>Donors</b>, please contact me via email or Discord if you would like a refund.<br><p>Thank you all,<br>Joel Jothiprakasam '21</p>

## [Announcement 6.3.7] - 2023-12-31 - Notification of Data Loss
- At some point before Dec 21, 2023, but after Dec 18, 2023, PowerSchool changed from displaying 23-24 S1 classes to 23-24 S2 classes.
- Unfortunately, the server was not prepared for this change, and this resulted in data loss for ~30% of users.
- If you are affected, you will see a notification in the Notification Panel.
- In summary, users fell into 3 categories:<ul>
- <b>1093</b> Users who created their account BEFORE the last backup, and did NOT sync AFTER the PowerSchool change<ul>
- These users will not be impacted</ul>
- <b>460</b> Users who created their account BEFORE the last backup, but synced AFTER the PowerSchool change<ul>
- These users will have their first semester 23-24 data rolled back to what it was when the data was backed up</ul>

- These users will have no data for the first semester of the 23-24 school year until PowerSchool unlocks again</ul></ul>

## [Announcement 4.9.9] - 2021-12-16
- First, thank you all for using Graderoom
- Due to the huge influx of users, my server crashed at some point before 5:54 PM today, and the database decided to delete itself
- <b>Luckily, I do have a backup system in place so all data created before 12/14/21 at 9:48:35 PM will still be here</b>
- <b>If you know anyone whose account may have been lost, please inform them that this happened</b>
- The server and database library I use for this app were not designed to handle this large of a user-base, which is what caused this
- Over break, I will make changes to the software to prevent this from happening again
- Hardware-wise, better servers cost money, and I do not yet know if I plan to monetize Graderoom to support a more high-end server. Let me know if you have any feedback on this.
