Prerequisite grades must be achieved in both the fall and spring semester of the courses in question. Open to qualified Juniors only. </p><p>The course is designed to prepare qualified students for the High School Calculus course in their senior year. The course will cover a blend of topics from Algebra 2 and Precalculus, with a focus on the basic foundational knowledge for success in Calculus. Students taking Accelerated Algebra 2 have two advancement options - Calculus and Precalculus. Precalculus Honors and Calculus AB AP are not advancement options. Please note that a student must earn a B- or better in Accelerated Algebra 2 in order to qualify for Calculus as a senior, or a C- or better to qualify for Precalculus. </p><p>Course Content: This course will apply and extend what students have learned in previous courses by focusing on finding connections between multiple representations of functions, transformations of different function families, finding zeros of polynomials and connecting them to graphs and equations of polynomials, and modeling periodic phenomena with trigonometry. The course is well balanced between procedural fluency (algorithms and basic skills), deep conceptual understanding, strategic competence (problem solving), and adaptive reasoning (extension and transference).On a daily basis, students use problem-solving strategies, questioning, investigating, analyzing critically, gathering and constructing evidence, and communicating rigorous arguments justifying their thinking. Under teacher guidance, students learn in collaboration with others while sharing information, expertise, and ideas. (Jan 2023) *UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Topics include: Stacks and queues, recursion, lists, dynamic arrays, binary search trees, iteration over collections, hashing, searching, elementary sorting and Big-O notation. The course covers the equivalent of two semesters of university level computer science for engineering majors. Introductory topics will be covered only briefly, allowing time for study of more advanced material. There will be several substantial projects each semester. The primary programming language will be Java with an introduction to C++ towards the end of the spring semester. (Reviewed January 2023)*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Students will learn and follow annotation, layout &amp; plotting standards for all classroom and project work. The course will move quickly through the introductory CAD 'how-to' lessons allowing more time to practice skills and develop project content. Students will complete a sequence of projects designed to demonstrate competency within the CAD environment. Classes will be a combination of lecture, discussion and lab work.

Students will learn about relevant topics in art history-such as abstract art, printmaking, relief sculpture, and mixed media assemblage-and develop skill in selecting appropriate media to use in their artwork to create their intended message. Students will develop proficiency in the use of the elements of art and the principles of design to create effective compositions. They will also participate in critiques, reflecting on constructive feedback given by peers for the purpose of personal artistic growth. By the end of the course, students will have completed three sustained investigations which may eventually contribute to the AP Drawing Exam portfolio.</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course (Reviewed/Updated December 2022)</p></div>

With Bellarmine's diverse population in mind, this course will challenge students to examine themselves through the study of African American Literature. Former California Poet Laureate Al Young states it another way: "You may think you are reading and thinking about African American literature, but, in reality, it is America herself you will be exploring and experiencing through literature." This course will examine the history and culture of African Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries, beginning with slave narratives. The course will progress through the genres of poetry, short story, drama and novels. Our study will also take us to African American cultural manifestations in speech, art, film, and music. Time will also be spent on August Wilson's dramatic vision and the blues as cultural artifact.</p><p><br></p><p>(Reviewed January 2017)</p><p><br></p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

The course is well balanced between procedural fluency (algorithms and basic skills), deep conceptual understanding, strategic competence (problem solving), and adaptive reasoning (extension and transference).On a daily basis, students use problem-solving strategies, questioning, investigating, analyzing critically, gathering and constructing evidence, and communicating rigorous arguments justifying their thinking. Under teacher guidance, students learn in collaboration with others while sharing information, expertise, and ideas. Students are expected to be proactive in reaching out for support when needed.

The goal is beginning students to acquire minimal conversational ability in ASL. By the end of the first academic school year, students will have studied survival Sign Language. In the process, they will learn certain cultural details. It is assumed that the students are in this class because they want to learn how to communicate in ASL. They will not have developed that ability completely by the end of the first academic year, but they will be surprised at how many communicative skills they will have acquired!</p><p> </p><p>Every effort will be made to make this class student-centered. That is, an activity will be modeled, and then you will work in pairs and small groups to assimilate the vocabulary, phrases with facial expressions. Students should make every effort not to speak and use sign exclusively to prepare for the classroom learning activities.(Revised December 2021) *UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Students will understand ASL glossing and how it differs from the English language. The most important goal for this level will be actively participating, both in and out of the classroom. This objective directly aligns with the National Standards for Foreign Language Learning.</p><p>Signing will be the used majority of the time in the classroom, as exposure to the language paired with an intense effort to understand what is being communicated is the most powerful tool for language acquisition. A non-verbal atmosphere may cause some initial stress or anxiety. Overcoming this anxiety, feel free to make mistakes and learn from them and supporting those around you to do the same is another goal I have for students in my class. If these goals can be accomplished students will have the ability to use what they learned at different local hangout of deaf people. </p><p>(Revised January 2022)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved</p></div>

Students will learn advanced modeling techniques using polygon mesh, NURBS, and digital sculpting. Students will learn to create advanced material maps and textures, lighting, and cameras, to bring their characters and environments to life. Students will build on their knowledge of Maya's animation tools to create advanced humanoid rigs, create expressive characters with shape blending, and stylized walk cycles. This course will conclude with a project in which students will create a 3D Animated project of their choosing. Emphasis will be placed on story structure, the principles of physical animation, and post-production techniques using Adobe Audition and Premiere.</p><p><span style="color: black;">(UC approved if taken with Animation 1)</span></p></div>

This course is open to students who have completed level 1 and level 2 art courses. </p><p>Teacher: Staff </p><p>Course Content: This course is designed to guide students in developing creative autonomy and further develop students' portfolios in preparation for submission to the AP 2D Art &amp; Design Portfolio Exam. Students develop 2-D skills through materials and processes such as graphic design, photography, collage, printmaking, and others. Students will develop their own inquiry questions relating to subject, form, and content that will segue into three to four sustained investigations. In each sustained investigation, students will document their creative process from ideation to final product with the goal of submitting 15 digital images as part of the exam. Students will be expected to adhere to a production schedule punctuated with work-in-progress critiques during the investigation as well as final critiques at the end of each investigation-the goal of critiques being self-reflection, revision, and experiencing the fruitful co-influencing that happens in artistic communities. Students will also receive guidance in selecting and preparing five of their best pieces to submit to the exam. *UC/CSU approved course (Proposed December 2022)</p></div>

Students will practice spoken and written Chinese in complex communicative activities, using practice sessions to fine-tune pronunciation, expand vocabulary, and internalize more complex grammatical constructions. Extensive speaking assignments on various topics, reading of authentic texts and writing in different genres and registers are required. They will also develop a more in-depth understanding of Chinese culture through projects and field trips.

Students will develop their own inquiry questions relating to subject, form, and content that will segue into three to four sustained investigations. In each sustained investigation, students will document their creative process from ideation to final product with the goal of submitting 15 digital images as part of the exam. Students will be expected to adhere to a production schedule punctuated with work-in-progress critiques during the investigation as well as final critiques at the end of each investigation-the goal of critiques being self-reflection, revision, and experiencing the fruitful co-influencing that happens in artistic communities. Students will also receive guidance in selecting and preparing five of their best pieces to submit to the exam.</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course (Reviewed/Updated December 2022)</p></div>

The course will cover the period of time beginning with the Paleolithic period and ending with Postmodernism. By examining works of art from diverse cultures and the relationships among these works, students develop an understanding of global artistic traditions. Students analyze works of art in their contexts, considering issues of patronage, gender, politics, religion, and ethnicity. The interpretation of the work of art is based upon its intended use, audience, and the role of the artist and the work of art in its particular society. Students will expand their knowledge of history, geography, politics, religion, languages, and literature, as they explore the story of people as told through the art they created. Students will take a field trip to the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco as part of the course.</p><p>(Revised August 2015)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course; NOT an NCAA-approved course</p></div>

							<div class="row short none" data-replace="desc_35"><p>60% of the world's population lives in Asia, the largest continent, home to over 40 countries. With so many ethnicities represented in Asia, how can there be a group called "Asian-Americans"? While the overly broad categorization does diminish individual cultures, the term "Asian-American" also implies a bond, a shared experience of being seen as the Eastern outsider in Western culture. This course will explore the common experience and literary voices among diverse Asian groups as they traverse immigration through hopeful acceptance.</p></div>

This African American literature elective for seniors will explore four plays from Wilson's Century Cycle which chronicles the experiences of African Americans in each decade of the twentieth century. Students will examine the historical context of each play, blues music, family relations and the American Dream, African ritual, African American Legacy, poetry, and art; in Wilson's hands, these elements come alive to celebrate Black culture through American dramatic literature. We will study four of Wilson's works: Gem of the Ocean (1904), Joe Turner's Come and Gone (1911), Fences (1957), Radio Golf (1997). We may also attend a performance by one of the Bay Area's African American theater companies.</p><p>(Revised January 2023)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Content is divided into nine units that extend beyond topics taught in CP Chemistry or Chemistry Honors. This is a lab-intensive course with a focus on inquiry, analysis, and lab technique. Both the difficulty and volume of material covered in this course will require considerable dedication from each student. This course is designed to: 1) further his knowledge of chemistry; 2) increase his laboratory skills and 3) prepare the student for the Chemistry AP exam. An AP Chemistry student should be an independent, self-motivated learner with strong analytical reasoning ability. He must have a strong interest in chemistry and performed well in his introductory chemistry course.</p><p>(Reviewed November 2021)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Required.</p><p>Teacher: Staff</p><p>Course Content: Christian Ethics is a required one-semester course in religious studies for juniors. This course examines the human experience of the moral life. The focus of this class is the Roman Catholic moral theological tradition even while examining ethical insights from a variety of philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions. The fundamental perspective of this course is that the moral life is an invitation to all persons to fulfill their human destiny in response to the gratuitous love of God. For Catholic Christians, the moral life is life in Jesus Christ, which is characterized by our loving one another as Jesus loved us. The nature of truth and goodness, development of moral character, formation of personal conscience, spiritual discernment in the Ignatian tradition, and criteria for judgment and action will be explored. Contemporary moral issues relating to consumer culture, human sexuality, alcohol and other drugs, technology and mass society, abortion, euthanasia, and the death penalty will be discussed. This course should be seen in direct relation to next semester's required religious studies course for juniors, Social Justice.</p><p>(Reviewed January 2015)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Students will study basic methods of reading and various ways of interpreting the biblical text, with emphasis on the contextual interpretation of scripture. Students will learn to read across the scriptures for a complex and complementary understanding of Jesus, his followers, and the Christian communities of faith. Special topics will include various theological understandings of Jesus, spiritual development, the scriptural basis of the sacraments, the role of women among Jesus disciples, and issues related to interfaith dialogue. In the Ignatian tradition, this course emphasizes the use of scripture for spiritual development and methods of prayer in Catholic spirituality.</p><p>(Reviewed March 2018)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Historical, economic, political, and especially cultural perspectives will be applied to theory and case studies to better understand why the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been plagued with so many wars, revolutions, uprisings, and violent movements. Case studies will focus on South East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Specific cases will include Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Israel/Palestine, and Rwanda. Instruction will be primarily lecture and discussion of readings. Assessment will take the form of teacher and self-generated portfolio style homework assignments, one research project that will culminate in an oral presentation, and an all essay midterm and final. Students will need strong research and note-taking skills, and an interest in history, culture, and social justice issues.  </span></p><p>(Reviewed January 2023)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Thompson as he travels to Las Vegas into "the Savage Heart of the American Dream" ... take a journey back in time to watch the most historic performances of rock gods Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at the Monterey Pop Festival ... journey into the frontiers of the mind with Timothy Leary ... find Eastern enlightenment with Ram Dass ... rage against the system with armed and hostile Black Panthers ... jam with musicians Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and other folk legends. Counterculture 2 begins with a brief background of the 1950s Beat Generation and then transitions into a study of the folk music and lyrics of Bob Dylan and his contemporaries, as they struggle to fight social injustice and protest the war. Next, the course will examine the Hippie movement in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, a New Journalistic account of the west coast counterculture of the Sixties. We will learn about the rise of Acid Rock and the events that led to the Summer of Love in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury. We will also study the essentials of New Journalism and Gonzo Journalism, two new forms of writing pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s. We will move on to uncover the true motivations of the revolutionary Black Panthers, including Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver, as they struggle for civil rights and an end to social inequality and persecution, initiating programs to serve the underprivileged in their communities. Why did they carry guns, what was their link to Malcolm X, what was their revolutionary philosophy that got them into so much trouble and what is their legacy?</p><p>(Revised January 2016)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Literature of the Counterculture is a journey into the minds of some revolutionary thinkers and a study of the Beat Generation. We will critique our society as well as discover ways to be just and compassionate stewards of our own world. In addition to the aforementioned authors, the works of Amiri Baraka, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lew Welch, Gregory Corso, and others will be read, performed, and discussed in order to gain a better understanding of these subcultures. Further, we will examine the musical form of Bebop jazz pioneered by artists like Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, Dizzie Gillespe, and Miles Davis. In regard to creative endeavors, we will experiment with spontaneous prose composition, created by Jack Kerouac, and we will study the California Assemblage movement and create our own bizarre but socially relevant sculptures. Lastly, we will view and discuss some groundbreaking experimental films by Beat magicians of the genre. In this class, prepare to be transformed!</p>

The course continues with the desire for relationship and community that are the foundation of the experience of Creed and Church.

							<div class="row short none" data-replace="desc_65"><p>Pre-requisites/Comments:&nbsp;Senior English elective.&nbsp;</p><p>Teacher:&nbsp;Staff</p><p>Course Content:&nbsp; Dive into the Matrix with William Gibson's character Case, the greatest criminal hacker in the world! Fight crime with Batman from the dark shadows of Gotham! Tag along with detective Rick Deckard in futuristic Los Angeles, as he eliminates Replicants, dangerous androids that are indistinguishable from humans! Find out where the internet really came from, as well as Red Bull, Raves and EDM! Tag along with Major Kusanagi, a futuristic cyborg who works for Japanese intelligence and is trying to bring down the most dangerous cyberterrorist in the world! Cyberpunk Literature is a genre of science fiction that began in the early 1980s, and is always set in the near future. It is based on the gritty hard-boiled detective stories of the 1930s, and is closely linked to a number of films and television programs that are still being made to this day. We will begin by learning about the origins of cyberpunk culture, the Rave scene, and cyberpunk literature and cinema, finding important links with the hippies of the 1960s and the Beat Generation of the 1950s. We will examine William Gibson's Neuromancer, the first cyberpunk novel ever written, which essentially predicts the existence of cyberspace and the internet. We will also explore the cinema of the period, taking a look at Blade Runner, the cult-favorite film directed by the legendary Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford, fresh from his Han Solo fame. Because Japanese culture had a tremendous impact in the visionary future of the 1980s, we will trace the rise of Anime and Manga in America, including the landmark releases of Akira and Ghost in the Shell in the United States in the '90s. We will also study the graphic novel, including The Dark Knight Returns, which reboots the Batman story in a very unexpected way, and Watchmen, a superhero mystery set in an alternative future. In addition, we will take a foray into the extremely alternative Afrofuturist Movement which envisions a multicultural future in space, and includes such musical legends as Sun Ra, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, and Grace Jones. Prepare for a bold journey into the future!.</p><p>(Revised January 2016)</p><p>*pending UC/CSU approval</p></div>

In reading and writing about characters and communities representing different voices, students will explore how these elements can conflict, forcing them to decide who they will be and how they will use this knowledge to identify and combat injustices in the world. Ultimately, students will come to an affirmation of themselves and understand and celebrate diversity. Using their analysis of literature, students will begin by focusing on the basis of argumentation; writing four one paragraph essays in the first semester. During the second semester, each student will write three multi-paragraph essays, introducing them to the structure that will serve as the basis of their writing throughout their Bellarmine English education.</p><p><br></p><p>(Reviewed Jan 2019)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

<p>
	Course Content:&nbsp; This course is designed to study American culture through the many voices which have comprised it in the past four hundred years of literary achievement. It seeks to explore what makes American literature American, how American literature reveals our cultural and ethnic richness, captures our unique history and experiences, inspires our own activism, and expresses our American literary voice.<br />
	The typical sophomore composition is a five-paragraph expository essay, approximately two to three pages long. Sophomores will be expected to compose three or four such essays during the first semester. During the second semester, students will write two of these essays as well as well as a six to ten page research paper.</p>

<p>
	Course Content:&nbsp; English II Honors is an accelerated course in which self-motivated students are challenged to read, discuss, and come to an in-depth understanding of numerous full length literary works and a large number of additional essays, stories and poems from the American literary canon. Each student will be required to demonstrate his understanding of these works through a variety of written and oral assignments. As a survey of American Literature, the course proposes to link the themes and characters of our national literature to the historical periods from which they evolve and are influenced. All four primary genres of literature are included in this coverage. This course uses a vocabulary syllabus similar to other sophomore classes, and in the area of composition, teaches the expository paper as well as the research paper. A seminar format is employed. This course is for students with a great interest in reading and in the exploration of literature.</p>

	Course Content: This creative writing class (formerly titled Creative Writing 1) will provide students an opportunity to explore their creative and imaginative potential in order to find themselves as writers and discover their true writing voice. The class is divided into three sections. 1) Discovering your own voice and learning to write stories about your life. 2) Character voice: learning how to create a character and mimic other authors&#39; voices. 3) Story Mechanics: the fundamentals of writing including plot, theme, character, description, dialogue, perspective, conflict, syntax, word choice, symbolism, and ultimately style. In order to accomplish these goals, the class will use open ended journaling as well as brainstorming activities to draw on a student&#39;s own life experiences for story material. We will also study and model the writings of master story tellers including William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, C.S. Lewis, Edgar Allan Poe, Bernard Malamud, Flannery O&#39;Connor, and John Updike, among others, in order to incorporate their techniques into original stories. Peer evaluations and public readings will also be used to understand criticism and how to incorporate criticism to better students&#39; writing.</p>

A place where characters lives impact others and trickle down through time. Faulkner created one of the most cohesive literary worlds with Yoknapatawpha County, a county in rural Mississippi which endures the changes of time from Native American rule through the fallout of the second world war. Unlike survey courses (American Lit, British Lit) or genre courses (Short Story, Science Fiction), this seminar tackles just one author, William Faulkner: an American, Southern writer of the first half of the 20th century whom most critics call "One of the most difficult and challenging of the last 100 years." This course will require reading some 7 short stories to learn about Faulkner's style and world before reading "The Sound and the Fury". This course will test your literary skills and your heart.

The emphasis of the program is to promote balance, safety, self-reflection, and the skills to navigate various situations and decisions that students may encounter throughout their teenage years. A major goal of the course is to build healthy communities where individuals look out for one another and feel empowered to make healthy decisions. Topics of the course include: Adolescent Development, Identity, Conformity &amp; Bystander Effects, Physical Health, Mental Health, Relationships, Communication, Substance Use, Sexual Health, Technology &amp; Social Media. Many students take this course in 9th grade, though advisors work creatively with students and families to fulfill this requirement in concert with the individualized interests of each student, in which case it can sometimes be fulfilled outside of the A-G schedule or during summer school.  Students earn UC credit for this course.  (UC approval pending)</span></p></div>

Through the reading of essay, short stories, journals, poems and novels, students will gain an understanding of the almost incomprehensible events known as the Final Solution. The class will examine tremendous acts of heroism and horrendous acts of evil, and in the process, consider morality, racism, prejudice, apathy, and obedience to authority. By studying how victims of the Holocaust dealt with deprivation, terror, and death, students will gain insights into a significant historical period, the dark side of human nature, and the enormous power of the human spirit in times of incredible despair.</p><p>(Reviewed January 2017)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Each thematic unit deals with one aspect of the spirituality of Ignatian decision-making, applying these tools to the real choices faced by seniors and college students. Each section of the course will consist of reading articles and excerpts from scholarly sources, watching a popular film that illustrates the articles, and writing a paper that synthesizes 1) the articles, 2) the film, and 3) the student's own life experiences. The ultimate goal of this course will be to prompt, promote, and assist personal reflection concerning one's call from God.(Revised November 2019)*not a UC/CSU approved course</p><p> </p><p><br></p><p>(Revised January 2020)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

<p>
	Course Content:&nbsp; This class will introduce students to technical drawing and drafting through Autodesk&rsquo;s AutoCAD platform. Students will begin by learning basic CAD skills (drawing and sketching in the CAD environment) and then quickly move into developing drawing content (in-class assignments &amp; projects). Students will learn and follow annotation, layout &amp; plotting standards for all classroom and project work. The course will move quickly through the introductory CAD &lsquo;how-to&rsquo; lessons allowing more time to practice skills and develop project content. Students will complete a sequence of projects designed to demonstrate competency within the CAD environment. Classes will be a combination of lecture, discussion and lab work.  This is an important primer course for all Engineering and Architecture students.</p>

Sections would cover the fundamental techniques in using the camera, sound, and editing to communicate narrative and emotional content. Students would be taught the basics of narrative layout, production planning, visual composition, lighting, sound recording techniques, continuity editing, and sound mixing. Students would receive instruction in the fundamental skills requited for narrative cinema, animation, documentary and the primary techniques utilized therein. [Students would receive instruction in how those fundamental skills &amp; accompanying techniques are utilized in narrative cinema, animation, and documentary.] With these tools, students should then learn how to take a production from concept through development, into execution and ultimately critique. This course would emphasize, as a path to effective communication, the interrelated aspects of each phase from conception to audience response. In that vein, course work would include individual and collaborative exercises/projects to highlight focused, productive collaboration &amp; communication as an essential part of utilizing the medium.</p><p><br></p><p>(Reviewed December 2017)</p></div>

Today, more than ever, we are bombarded with countless post-apocalyptic films, TV shows, and video games. Political and environmental activists warn with increasing fervor the potential for extinction through nuclear annihilation or climate change. Constantly, we are asked to imagine various scenarios for human extinctionclimate catastrophe, nuclear annihilation, alien invasions, zombie infestations, disease outbreaks, robot uprisings, human infertility, and more. The driving question of this course is why have we become so obsessed with the apocalypse? What does this anxiety with our extinction reveal about our society today? We will use this genre about the end of the world to explore fundamental philosophical questions about human existence in the modern world: the dangers of science and progress, the problem of evil, the legitimate forms of political and moral authority, and ultimately, what it means to be human and have purpose in ones life.(Reviewed January 2020) *UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

This course is designed to be the equivalent of a first-year calculus-based physics course that is typically taken in college by students majoring in the physical sciences or engineering. Students are required to take the two AP Physics C exams: 1) Mechanics and 2) Electricity &amp; Magnetism. Like the AP Physics 1 course, Physics C AP is designed for the student who is superior in both ability and motivation in the scientific area. However, this course requires students to be more self-sufficient than students in the Physics 1 course, and the level of study, discussion, assigned problems, classroom presentations, and labs/projects is more complex.</p><p>Teacher: Staff</p><p>Course Content: Physics C: Mechanics and Electricity &amp; Magnetism AP is a one-year calculus-based physics course. Mechanics topics covered include: One and two-dimensional Kinematics; Kinetics (Newton's Laws of Motion); Work-Energy; Impulse-Momentum; and Rotational Kinematics, Kinetics, Energy, and Momentum. Electricity &amp; Magnetism topics covered include: Electrostatics, Capacitor and Dielectrics, Electrical Circuits, Magnetic Fields including the Biot-Savart law, and Electromagnetism with an emphasis on Maxwell's Equations.</p><p>(Reviewed January 2020)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

As such, students will be responsible for assisting in the planning and execution of various school activities and events such as rallies, liturgies, retreats, and service drives. Students accepted into the class must fulfill all required service hours, be in good academic and personal standing, and uphold the values stated in Bellarmine's school mission.

Required.</p><p>Teacher: Staff</p><p>Course Content: Social Justice is a required one-semester course in religious studies for juniors. This course explores the social dimension of moral obligation. The foundation of this course is informed by faith in Jesus Christ, biblical ideals of justice and righteousness, and the Catholic moral tradition. Catholic social teaching - the moral teaching of the Catholic Church on social, economic, political, cultural and religious issues - is given special consideration throughout the semester. The fundamental perspective of this course in social justice is recognition that the human person is made in the image of God and endowed with dignity which is manifest in community with others. The following contemporary issues are among those examined during the semester: ideals of justice, human rights, poverty in the midst of wealth, hunger, racism, sexism, violence, war and peace, issues in political economy such as international trade, and environmental stewardship. This course should be seen in direct relation to the previous semester's required religious studies course for juniors, Christian Ethics.</p><p>(Reviewed January 2015)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Ours is an era of increasingly complex visual representations, but how well are we prepared to evaluate and analyze information communicated through these mediums? This course seeks to give students evaluative tools and language to examine more closely the world around them by studying graphic novels and comics, or what author and artist, Eddie Campbell, describes as "an emerging new literature of our times in which word, picture, and typography interact meaningfully and which is in tune with the complexity of modern life with its babble of signs and symbols and stimuli."

	Course Content:&nbsp; Journeys. We all undertake them. To the store, to a ballgame, to a new school. We also undertake more profound journeys through personal struggles and challenges. Throughout human history, stories about &ldquo;the hero&rdquo; also have abounded. In this course, we will study some of these stories and how, interestingly enough, how the journeys of these many heroes across time and cultures are very much alike and very much like our own. This course will examine how those journeys have played themselves out in various literary pieces as well as in nonfiction pieces and in film.&nbsp; The course work will include pieces as varied as <em>Siddhartha</em>, <em>Home</em> (Toni Morrison), <em>The River Why</em> (by the author of the Brothers K), <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, and St<em>ar Wars</em>.&nbsp; Course work will involve small group assignments, oral presentations, personal reflection, and several&nbsp;expository essays as well as reading and writing assignments.</p>

Gunslingers, outlaws, and cowboys: every American knows these figures. Our understanding of justice and heroism, as well as our culture's obsession with violence, come from our narratives about the Wild West. In this course, we will start by analyzing classic Western films to see the origin of America's foundational myth. Then, we will study more contemporary neo-Westerns to see how directors have complicated those foundational values. Finally, we will investigate Western novels, climaxing with Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, to see how contemporary authors have deconstructed the genre. </p><p><br></p><p> Ultimately, by studying the Wild West, this course will explore not only the development the America's core values but also the universal human need for grand narratives and myths to understand our place in the world. At its heart, this course raises the question of how we as individuals and as a society make meaning and how those forms of meaning translate to moral codes.</p><p> (Reviewed January 2023) *UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

If you haven't had that experience this class is definitely for you. Theology, Spirituality and Nature is an elective one-semester course in religious studies for seniors. This course examines the human experience of awe and wonder when encountering the mystery of life in nature. This class focuses on Roman Catholic theological and spiritual traditions while examining other spiritual and philosophical experiences of transcendence through encounters in nature. The fundamental perspective of this course is rooted in revelation of the prophetic Word of God: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts! All the earth is filled with God's glory!(Isaiah 6:3). This course on spirituality and nature is based on biblical texts, the faith and tradition of Catholic Church, wisdom from religious traditions and philosophy, and the words and actions of saints and heroes of the environment, for example, St. Francis of Assisi, Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. Contemporary social issues relating to environmental stewardship, wilderness preservation, conservation, exploitation, pollution, and destruction will be addressed from perspectives of Catholic social teaching. A central dimension of this course depends upon student encounters with creation and nature followed by reflection on those experiences. (Revised January 2015) *UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

However, so often the voices from oppressed ethnic communities are suppressed and unheard in terms of their struggles and how it has shaped their spiritual journeys. This course aims to build in students a sense of solidarity with these oppressed communities and build their responsibility to be allies of the oppressed in working for liberation and the building of the Kingdom of God. This course will attempt to draw students into an analysis of spiritualities/theologies arising from varying oppressed ethnic communities including the African American Experience, Latin American Experience, and Asian American Experience (includes Chinese American, Filipino American, Japanese American, Korean American, South East Asian, and Vietnamese American). The intent is to lift these voices from the underside creating a better understanding of faith in action. Envisioned are students who leave this course more truly committed to being for and with others(Pedro Arrupe, SJ).</p><p>(Revised January 2018)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>

Interpretive skills appropriate to religious studies will be explored through films and readings with opportunities for daily meditation, journal, discuss and write responses. The goals of the course are to impart understanding of the essential doctrines and institutions of the world's religions, stressing their founding and normative principles; to identify similarities and differences of thought and practice among the traditions; to understand a Catholic response to dialogue; and to clarify and articulate one's own religious attitudes and orientations in the context of comparative study. </p><p>(Reviewed January 2020)</p><p>*UC/CSU approved course</p></div>
